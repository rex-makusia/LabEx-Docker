# Introduction
In this lab, we will explore Docker images, which are the foundation for creating and running containers. 
We will learn how to pull images from Docker Hub, run containers using different image versions, list and remove images, understand image layers, search for images, and perform basic image tagging. This hands-on experience will provide you with essential skills for working with Docker images effectively. 
Don't worry if you're new to Docker - we'll guide you through each step with detailed explanations.
