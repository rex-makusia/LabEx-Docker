# Introduction
Welcome to the "Run Your First Container" challenge! You've already learned how to run the hello-world container. 
Now, let's take it a step further and run a different, interesting container. 
In this challenge, you'll use your newly acquired Docker skills to run a container that displays a fun message.

# Run a New Container
## Tasks
Your task is simple:

1. Run a Docker container based on the ```docker/getting-started``` image.

## Requirements
To complete this challenge, you must:

1. Use the ```docker run``` command to start the container.

2. Use the image ```docker/getting-started```.
   
Execute the command in the ```~/project``` directory.

```docker
labex:project/ $ docker images

```
Verify the Docker process
```docker
Docker ps

```

# Summary
In this challenge, you've expanded your Docker skills by running a new container. 
You've used the ```docker run``` command to start a container from the ```docker/getting-started``` image, which displays some introductory information about Docker. 
This exercise reinforces your understanding of how to use Docker to run containers and introduces you to a new, informative Docker image. It's a great way to see how Docker can be used to quickly access and run pre-configured applications. 
Keep exploring different Docker images to continue expanding your containerization skills!
